# Predict Customer Purchase Intention

<img src="Visuals/online_shopping.jpeg">

# Business Problem
An online retailer wants to optimize profit margin based on visitors intent of purchase. The retailer is setting up a personalized customer experience where a visitor who is identified as some one that will make a purchase may not receive a discount. On the other hand a visitor who is identified as some one that does not intent on purchasing may be offered a promotional discount to incentivize the visitor to make a purchase.<br>
To predict website visitors who actually will purchase the metric recall will be used. Recall takes false negatives (visitors who actually purchase but model predicts they do not) into consideration and therefore is a good measure of model's performance whether it can correctly identify all those visitors whose intention is to purchase.<br>
